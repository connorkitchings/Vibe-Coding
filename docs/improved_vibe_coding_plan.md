**Unified Vibe‑Coding Project Blueprint**

A flexible, structured workflow to take any idea from spark to delivery, while preserving creative momentum and AI‑powered efficiency.

---

## Phase 0: Idea Validation & Scope Check

1. **Rapid Feasibility Audit** (5–10 min)

   - **Problem Fit**: Does it solve something you genuinely care about?
   - **MVP Window**: Can you deliver a usable prototype in 2–4 weeks (part‑time)?
   - **Sustained Engagement**: Will you stay excited after week 2?
   - **Learning Benefit**: Does it stretch your skills just enough?

2. **AI‑Driven Stress Test**\
   Prompt AI:

   - “What are the hardest parts of building [idea]?”
   - “What simpler alternatives or pivots exist?”
   - “Name 3 reasons this might fail.”

3. **Go/No‑Go Checklist**

## Phase 1: High‑Level Planning (3‑File System)

Use three living files to capture decisions, tasks, and learnings. Store them in your repo’s `/docs` or root folder.

### 1. PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (PRD.md)

```
PROJECT: [Name]
GOAL: (1–2 sentences)
USERS: [_primary persona_]
CORE FEATURES:
  • Feature A (must‑have)
  • Feature B (must‑have)
  • Feature C (nice‑to‑have)
OUT OF SCOPE:
  • …
SUCCESS METRICS:
  • Usage criteria
  • Performance targets
```

**AI Prompts:**

- “Draft a PRD for [idea] aimed at a solo developer MVP.”
- “What edge cases belong in this PRD?”

### 2. TASK BREAKDOWN (Tasks.md)

```
SPRINT 🚀 (1 week):
  [ ] Task 1 (2 h)
  [ ] Task 2 (4 h)
BACKLOG 🔮:
  – …
DONE ✅:
  – [DATE] Completed Task 1: Notes…
BLOCKERS 🛑:
  – Task X blocked by [issue]
```

**Tip:** Estimate in hours; keep sprints ≤ 1 week.

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION LOG (Notes.md)

```
##### [YYYY‑MM‑DD]
**What Worked:**
  – …
**What Didn’t:**
  – …
**AI Tricks:**
  – Prompt: “…” → Good response on [topic]
**Decisions:**
  – Chose [library] over [alternative] because…
**Next Up:**
  – …
```

**Context Feeding:** At each session start, paste last 2–3 entries into your AI assistant.

## Phase 2: Conversational Requirements

- **User Journeys:** Ask AI “Write 3 user stories for my PRD.”
- **Risk Workshop:** “Name 5 ways this could break or be misused.”
- **Constraint Map:** List what must stay vs. what can flex.

**Exit Criteria:**

-

## Phase 3: Light‑weight Architecture & Tech Stack

1. **Stack Rapid‑Fire:**\
   AI Prompt: “Simplest stack to build [core feature] in Python/JS?”
2. **Component Sketch:**
   - Draft ASCII or text diagram via AI.
3. **Decision Log:**
   - Option A vs. B → Chosen C → Why?
   - Reversibility note for future pivot.

**Checkpoints:**

-

---

## Phase 4: Iterative AI‑Powered Development

For each task:

1. **Session Kickoff:** Feed PRD + last Notes + current Tasks.
2. **Generate & Review:** “Write a testable module for [feature], include comments and error checks.”
3. **Test & Tweak:** Break it—invalid inputs, edge cases.
4. **Log Learnings:** Update Notes.md with insights.

**Multi‑AI Tip:** If stuck, swap models (GPT, Claude, Perplexity) on the same prompt and compare.

---

## Phase 5: MVP Delivery & Maintenance

- **MVP Definition:** Core use‑case works smoothly.
- **AI‑Enhanced Testing:** “Generate 10 test cases for [module].”
- **Deployment Lite:** Local or free hosting (Heroku, Vercel, Colab).
- **Sustain Plan:** List monthly health‑check tasks.

**MVP Checklist:**

### Tips for Vibe‑Coding Success

- **Keep Files Lean:** 3 docs only—update them constantly.
- **AI as Co‑Pilot, Not Dictator:** Always validate hallucinations.
- **Short Sprints:** Weekly cycles keep momentum.
- **Context Discipline:** Copy/paste only what’s relevant to minimize noise.

Use this blueprint as your adaptable backbone—tweak phases, names, and deliverables to match your personal rhythm and project scale. Happy vibe‑coding! 🚀

# Lessons Learned

> Patterns and mistakes to avoid. Review at session start. Update after any correction.

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Review at session start** — Check for relevant lessons before starting work
2. **Add after corrections** — Whenever the user corrects you, capture the pattern
3. **Iterate ruthlessly** — Refine rules until the same mistake stops happening

---

## Correction Patterns

> Lessons from user corrections. Each entry captures the mistake, the rule to prevent it, and the date.

### [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]

**Mistake:**
> What went wrong (from user correction)

**Root Cause:**
> Why it happened

**Rule Added:**
> Specific rule to prevent this mistake

**Example:**
> What you should have done instead

---

### Template for New Entries

```markdown

**Mistake:**
> [Brief description of what went wrong]

**Root Cause:**
> [Why it happened - be honest]

**Rule Added:**
> [Specific actionable rule]

**Example:**
> [What you should have done]
```

# Vibe Coding Project Template Plan

## Notes

- User wants to center AI sessions on concise and relevant requirements.
- Initial focus is on reviewing documents in the `documents` directory to inform the project template.
- Core documents (PRD, backlog, dev_log) each have clear structure and update cadence;
  integration docs (knowledge_base, quality_gates, enhanced_documentation_system, global_rules)
  provide standards, automation, and cross-linking patterns.
- Notable best practices: session start/end checklists, cross-document references, quality
  gates (lint/tests/coverage/mutation/docs), onboarding scripts, and automation for context
  gathering and validation.
- The enhanced system emphasizes explicit session handoffs, historical traceability, and
  automation for reduced cognitive load and better knowledge transfer.
- Dev log files have been consolidated and simplified into a single, streamlined `dev_log.md`
  with trimmed project context and a unified session template.
- PRD and project context serve different audiences and should remain separate, but should
  cross-link for clarity (see PRD for goals, project context for architecture/tech details).
- Implementation schedule (`implementation_schedule.md`) has replaced the backlog; all
  documentation and system references have now been updated accordingly.
- Next step: validate the template and perform final cleanup (shorten long table rows, move
  configs, cross-link docs).

## Task List

- [x] Review all files in the `documents` directory for relevance and completeness
- [x] Summarize key requirements and documentation patterns
- [x] Consolidate dev log files into a single streamlined document
- [x] Draft an improved project template structure based on findings
- [x] Transform backlog into implementation schedule
- [x] Update all documentation/system references from backlog to implementation schedule
- [ ] Shorten long table rows in implementation_schedule.md (optional lint fix)
- [ ] Move large config/code examples out of enhanced_documentation_system.md
- [x] Add cross-links between PRD, implementation schedule, and project context
- [ ] Validate the template against user goals for vibe coding

## Current Goal

Validate the template and perform final cleanup
